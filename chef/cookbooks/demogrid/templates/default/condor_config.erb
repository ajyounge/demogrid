##  Condor needs to create a few lock files to synchronize access to
##  various log files.  Because of problems we've had with network
##  filesystems and file locking over the years, we HIGHLY recommend
##  that you put these lock files on a local partition on each
##  machine.  If you don't have your LOCAL_DIR on a local partition,
##  be sure to change this entry.  Whatever user (or group) condor is
##  running as needs to have write access to this directory.  If
##  you're not running as root, this is whatever user you started up
##  the condor_master as.  If you are running as root, and there's a
##  condor account, it's probably condor.  Otherwise, it's whatever
##  you've set in the CONDOR_IDS environment variable.  See the Admin
##  manual for details on this.
